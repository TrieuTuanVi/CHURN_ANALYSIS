## 💡 Project Insights:
- Female customers account for the majority of churn (~64.1%) — higher than males.
- Customers aged 30-50 show the highest churn rate (~31.6%).
- Month-to-Month contract users make up the largest portion of churn (~46.5%).
- Customers paying via Mailed Check churn the most (~37.8%).
- Long-term customers (>18 months) show increasing churn trend (~28%).
- Jammu and Assam are the states with the highest churn rates (57.2% and 38.1%).
- Customers without Internet Service and Online Security have the highest churn risk.

## ✅ Final Conclusion:
To reduce churn, focus on female customers aged 30-50 using Month-to-Month contracts and Mailed Check payment. Encourage contract upgrades, promote Internet & Security packages, automate payment methods, and improve service quality in high-risk states like Jammu and Assam.
